						<h2>Notice of Claims of Intellectual Property Right Infringement</h2>
						<div class="st-section__main">
							<p class="bodytxt">
								Enigmo allows intellectual property rights owners to ask 
								us to remove certain item or listing that infringes on their intellectual property rights. 
								These rights can include trademark, copyright and other legal rights.
								<br>Because intellectual property owners are ultimately responsible for 
								protecting their intellectual property, and Enigmo is not an expert in an 
								intellectual property owner's rights, we need your help in identifying 
								items and listings that you believe may infringe your rights.
								<br>If an item or listing infringes on your intellectual property rights, 
								you can report the alleged infringement to Enigmo's designated agent by 
								providing the following information in writing:
							</p>
							<ul class="number--normal">
								<li>a physical or electronic signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of 
									an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
								</li>
								<li>a description of the intellectual property right claimed to 
									have been infringed;
								</li>
								<li>a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on our site, 
									with enough detail that we may find it on the site;
								</li>
								<li>your address, telephone number, and email address;</li>
								<li>a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not 
									authorized by the exclusive right owner, its agent, or the law;
								</li>
								<li>a statement by you that the information in your notice is 
									accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are the exclusive 
									right owner or authorized to act on the exclusive right owner's
									behalf.
								</li>
							</ul>
